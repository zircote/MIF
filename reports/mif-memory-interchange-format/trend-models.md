## 5. Regulatory Impact Timeline

### EU AI Act Compliance Cascade

```mermaid
timeline
    title EU AI Act Compliance Milestones
    section 2024
        AI Act Enters Force : August 2024
    section 2025
        Prohibited AI Bans : February 2025
        GPAI Rules Apply : August 2025
    section 2026
        High-Risk Conformity : August 2026
        Data Governance Required : Q4 2026
    section 2027
        Full Enforcement : August 2027
        Existing Systems Comply : December 2027
```

### Compliance Pressure on Memory Interoperability

| Milestone | Date | Impact on MIF Adoption |
|-----------|------|------------------------|
| Data governance rules | Q4 2026 | MEDIUM - Creates awareness of provenance needs |
| High-risk conformity | Aug 2026 | HIGH - Requires documented data lineage |
| Full enforcement | Aug 2027 | CRITICAL - Non-compliance = market access loss |
| Existing system compliance | Dec 2027 | PEAK - Largest migration wave |

**Forecast:** 70% of enterprise MIF adoption decisions will be compliance-driven by 2027.

    end

    subgraph Response Types
        B --> C[Ignore]
        B --> D[Adopt MIF]
        B --> E[Counter-Standard]
        B --> F[Proprietary Lock-in]
    end

|----------|--------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Mem0** | 30% | 50% | 10% | 10% |
| **Zep** | 20% | 60% | 15% | 5% |
| **Letta** | 10% | 25% | 55% | 10% |
| **LangMem** | 40% | 45% | 10% | 5% |
| **Cognee** | 35% | 45% | 10% | 10% |
| **Graphlit** | 50% | 35% | 5% | 10% |

**Key Insight:** Letta most likely to launch counter-standard (Agent File evolution). Zep most likely to adopt MIF due to temporal alignment.

    Awareness, Evaluation, 60
    Awareness, Drop-off, 40
    Evaluation, POC, 45
    Evaluation, Drop-off, 15
    POC, Pilot, 35
    POC, Drop-off, 10
    Pilot, Production, 28
    Pilot, Drop-off, 7
```

| Stage | Conversion Rate | Typical Duration | Key Blocker |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Awareness → Evaluation | 60% | 2-4 weeks | Unclear value proposition |
| Evaluation → POC | 75% | 2-4 weeks | Missing tooling |
| POC → Pilot | 78% | 4-8 weeks | Integration complexity |
| Pilot → Production | 80% | 8-12 weeks | Governance approval |

**Overall Conversion:** 28% Awareness → Production
**Forecast:** With tooling and governance improvements, target 40% by Q4 2026.
