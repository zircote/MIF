# MIF Market Research Report

**Topic:** Memory Interchange Format (MIF) - Open Standard for AI Memory Interoperability
**Status:** Complete
**Generated:** 2026-01-23

## Overview

This research investigates the market opportunity and technical landscape for MIF, a proposed open standard for AI memory interoperability. The research was conducted to support specification design decisions and adoption strategy.

## Key Findings

- **No incumbent standard exists** - Six major providers (Mem0, Zep, Letta, LangMem, Cognee, Graphlit) use incompatible formats
- **MIF targets an unoccupied market quadrant** - No competitor offers both rich semantic models AND open interoperability
- **Regulatory pressure creates urgency** - EU AI Act compliance deadline (August 2027) will force enterprises to implement data provenance
- **First-mover advantage window is 12-18 months**

## Market Size

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Addressable Market | $15.2B (AI Memory Infrastructure) |
| Serviceable Market | $2.1B (Memory Tools) |
| Obtainable (3-year) | $85M (MIF Ecosystem) |
| Growth Rate | 34% CAGR |

## Report Files

| File | Description | Audience |
|------|-------------|----------|
| [executive-brief.md](./executive-brief.md) | 1-page decision summary | Executives, Product |
| [report.md](./report.md) | Comprehensive analysis (~4500 words) | Technical, Product |
| [trend-models.md](./trend-models.md) | Scenario modeling and trend analysis | Strategic Planning |
| [state.json](./state.json) | Raw research data and findings | Technical Reference |

## Research Areas Covered

1. **Standards Analysis** - JSON-LD, RDF/OWL, ONNX, Temporal standards
2. **Competitor Analysis** - Mem0, Zep, Letta, LangMem, Cognee, Graphlit
3. **Enterprise Requirements** - EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, GDPR
4. **Adoption Patterns** - Lessons from JSON-LD, ONNX, OpenAPI adoption

## Primary Recommendations

### High Priority Spec Changes
- Add optional `lineage[]` array for transformation chain tracking
- Add `hash` field at memory level for integrity verification
- Add EDTF support in temporal model for uncertain dates
- Define canonical embedding model identifiers (ONNX + HuggingFace)

### Adoption Strategy
1. **Immediate:** Build Python mif-tools package
2. **Short-term:** Ship Obsidian plugin, build Mem0/Letta converters
3. **Medium-term:** Submit W3C Community Group, partner with governance vendors

## Sources

Research draws from 15 primary sources including:
- W3C specifications (JSON-LD 1.1, PROV-DM, OWL)
- Academic papers (Zep Temporal Knowledge Graph, BiTemporal RDF)
- Vendor documentation (Mem0, Letta, Cognee, Graphlit)
- Industry reports (Enterprise AI Governance Guide 2025)

Full source list available in [state.json](./state.json).
