## Specification Change Guidelines

### Backward Compatibility

- Additive changes (new optional fields) are preferred
- Breaking changes require major version bump
- Use conformance levels to add features progressively

### Documentation Requirements

All specification changes must include:
- Clear description of the change
- Rationale for the addition
- Example in both Markdown and JSON-LD formats
- Impact on conformance levels (if any)

### Code Examples

When adding examples:
- Use language tags on all code blocks
- Ensure JSON is valid and parseable
- Ensure YAML frontmatter is valid
- Test wiki-link syntax in Obsidian if possible

## Style Guide

### Specification Language

- Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) appropriately
- Be precise and unambiguous
- Include rationale for design decisions

### Markdown Formatting

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags
- Use tables for structured comparisons
- Keep lines under 120 characters when possible
