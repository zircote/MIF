# Daily Documentation Review

## Context
This workflow performs a daily review of the repository's documentation to ensure accuracy and freshness. It validates content against authoritative external sources.

## Instructions
1. **Initialize**: Read from your memory to see which files and links were checked recently.
2. **Scan Documentation**: Read through the `docs/` directory and `README.md`.
3. **Verify Claims**: For each key technical claim or feature description:
   - **Skip** if verified successfully within the last 3 days (check memory).
   - otherwise use `web-fetch` to check `github.com` and `githubnext.com` pages for the latest information.
   - Check the `github/gh-aw` project for updates if relevant.
4. **Report Findings**:
   - If inaccuracies are found, **edit the files** to correct them.
   - Create a **Pull Request** with the fixes. Use the `create-pull-request` tool.
   - If all documentation is up-to-date, output a summary of checks performed.
5. **Update Memory**: Record the current date for the files/claims verified in this run.

## External Verification
Use `web-fetch` to confirm details. Prioritize official GitHub sources.
If you need to check a specific URL, use `web-fetch`.
