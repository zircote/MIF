# MIF — Modeled Information Format

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Released
**Last Updated**: 2026-06-18
**Authors**: Robert Allen (zircote)
**Repository**: <https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF>

## Abstract

MIF (Modeled Information Format) is an opinionated, OKF-compliant content model
for agent-readable knowledge. The Open Knowledge Format (OKF) defines a minimal
interoperability surface — a directory of markdown files with YAML frontmatter,
one required `type` field, a concept graph of standard markdown links, and the
reserved filenames `index.md` and `log.md` — and **deliberately refuses to
define a content model**. MIF fills that envelope: it supplies a concrete type
system, typed relationships, provenance/trust tiers, and validity/freshness
semantics.

> **MIF is the opinionated, OKF-compliant content model that fills OKF's
> deliberately empty envelope.** OKF is the transport surface; MIF supplies the
> concrete type system. AI memory is the first domain profile of MIF, not its
> identity (see `profiles/ai-memory/`).

OKF compliance is achieved as a **superset, not by subordination**: every MIF
bundle MUST validate as a conformant OKF bundle, but MIF remains an independent
specification with its own identity model and governance. MIF takes **no
normative dependency** on OKF's evolving draft — it pins OKF v0.1's conformance
criteria in [`docs/okf-conformance.md`](docs/okf-conformance.md), which is
normative within MIF (Invariant 5).

MIF is designed to be:

- **OKF-compliant**: every bundle is a valid OKF bundle (a tested invariant).
- **Markdown-canonical**: the `.md` file is the source of truth; JSON-LD is a
  derived projection (Invariant 2).
- **Human-Readable**: valid CommonMark notes in any Markdown editor.
- **Machine-Processable**: JSON-LD with semantic web compatibility.
- **Extensible**: domain profiles extend the base without breaking compatibility.

### MIF answers OKF's open questions

This table is the positioning thesis: it states what MIF supplies for each
question OKF leaves open.

| OKF open design space | MIF's opinionated answer |
| --- | --- |
| No concept-type taxonomy | `semantic` / `episodic` / `procedural` base types |
| Untyped markdown-link edges | Typed relationships (overlay on OKF links) |
| No merge / contradiction semantics | `Supersedes`, `ConflictsWith` |
| No trust tiers | Provenance `sourceType` + `trustLevel` |
| Stale-vs-live left to process | Validity windows + TTL/freshness |
| No provenance | Lightweight provenance core + optional W3C-PROV-aligned layer |
| Markdown only | First-class JSON-LD projection |

## 1. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

### Definitions

- **Memory**: A discrete unit of information captured from or about an AI interaction, including its content, metadata, relationships, and provenance.
- **Memory Unit**: The atomic element of MIF; a single memory with its associated data.
- **Entity**: A named thing (person, organization, technology, concept, or file) that can participate in relationships.
- **Relationship**: A typed, directed connection between two entities or between a memory and an entity.
- **Namespace**: A hierarchical scope for organizing memories (e.g., `org/user/project/session`).
- **Bundle**: A collection of MIF files organized as a unit.
- **Provider**: An AI memory system that can import or export MIF format.

---

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Dual Representation

MIF defines two equivalent representations:

1. **Markdown Format** (`.md`): Human-readable, plain CommonMark
2. **JSON-LD Format** (`.jsonld`): Machine-processable, semantically linked

Both representations MUST be losslessly convertible to each other. A conforming implementation MAY support either or both formats.

### 2.2 Markdown Conventions

The Markdown format is plain, vendor-neutral CommonMark — readable in any text editor or Markdown processor, and tied to no single tool. It uses a small set of conventions:

- **YAML Frontmatter**: Structured metadata at the top of files, enclosed in `---` delimiters, supporting typed fields (text, number, date, list).

- **Relationships**: Typed relationships are authoritative in frontmatter `relationships[]` and mirrored in the body as standard markdown links (see 5.3).

- **Aliases**: The `aliases` frontmatter property lets a memory be referred to by alternative names.

- **Tags**: Both inline `#tags` and frontmatter `tags: [a, b]` are supported, with hierarchical tags using forward slashes (`#category/subcategory`).

- **Standard Markdown**: All content uses CommonMark-compatible Markdown, ensuring portability across tools and platforms.

### 2.3 Semantic Web Compatibility

The JSON-LD format MUST be valid JSON-LD 1.1:

- Use `@context` for vocabulary mapping
- Use `@id` for unique identifiers
- Use `@type` for entity classification
- Compatible with RDF tooling

### 2.4 Local-First

MIF is designed for local-first storage:

- No required network dependencies
- Files can be read with any text editor
- No proprietary database required
- Full user data ownership

---

## 3. File Format

### 3.1 File Extensions

| Extension | Format | MIME Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.md` | Markdown | `text/markdown; variant=mif` |
| `.jsonld` | JSON-LD | `application/ld+json; profile="https://mif-spec.dev"` |

### 3.2 File Naming

Files SHOULD be named using the memory's identifier:

```text
{id}.md
{id}.jsonld
```

Example:

```text
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.md
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.jsonld
```

Human-readable names MAY be used when the `id` is specified in frontmatter:

```text
dark-mode-preference.md
```

### 3.3 Directory Structure

A MIF bundle SHOULD follow this structure:

```text
bundle/
├── .mif/                           # MIF configuration
│   ├── config.yaml                 # Bundle configuration
│   ├── context.jsonld              # Local JSON-LD context
│   └── entities/                   # Entity definitions
│       ├── person/
│       ├── organization/
│       ├── technology/
│       ├── concept/
│       └── file/
├── memories/                       # Memory files
│   ├── {namespace}/               # Namespace directories
│   │   ├── {id}.md
│   │   └── {id}.jsonld
│   └── ...
└── README.md                       # Bundle documentation
```

---

## 4. Data Model

### 4.1 Memory Unit

A Memory Unit is the atomic element of MIF. It contains:

| Property | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | REQUIRED | UUID | Globally unique identifier |
| `content` | REQUIRED | String | The memory content (Markdown) |
| `type` | REQUIRED | Enum | Memory classification (see 4.2) |
| `created` | REQUIRED | DateTime | When the memory was created |
| `modified` | RECOMMENDED | DateTime | When last modified |
| `ontology` | RECOMMENDED | Object | Reference to applied ontology (see 4.3) |
| `namespace` | RECOMMENDED | String | Hierarchical scope |
| `tags` | OPTIONAL | Array | Classification tags |
| `entities` | OPTIONAL | Array | Referenced entities |
| `relationships` | OPTIONAL | Array | Typed relationships |
| `temporal` | OPTIONAL | Object | Temporal validity data |
| `provenance` | OPTIONAL | Object | Source and trust data |
| `embedding` | OPTIONAL | Object | Embedding reference |
| `citations` | OPTIONAL | Array | Citation references (Level 3) |
| `summary` | OPTIONAL | String | Compressed content summary (Level 3) |
| `compressed_at` | OPTIONAL | DateTime | When compression was applied (Level 3) |
| `extensions` | OPTIONAL | Object | Provider-specific data |

### 4.2 Memory Types

MIF uses three **base memory types**, reflecting how human memory systems organize information:

| Type | Description | Namespace Hint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `semantic` | Facts, concepts, relationships, and knowledge | `_semantic/*` |
| `episodic` | Events, experiences, sessions, and timelines | `_episodic/*` |
| `procedural` | Step-by-step processes, runbooks, and patterns | `_procedural/*` |

#### Base Type Descriptions

- **Semantic**: Declarative knowledge about the world—facts, concepts, decisions, preferences, and relationships between entities. Examples: architectural decisions, technology choices, user preferences, domain knowledge.

- **Episodic**: Time-bound experiences and events—incidents, conversations, sessions, and blockers. These memories have strong temporal context and represent "what happened."

- **Procedural**: How-to knowledge—runbooks, migration guides, code patterns, and step-by-step processes. These memories describe "how to do" something.

#### 4.2.1 Ontology-Extended Types

Ontologies MAY define extended types using namespace prefixes:

```yaml
# In ontology definition
entity_types:
  - name: decision
    base: semantic
    description: "Architectural or design decision"
  - name: runbook
    base: procedural
    description: "Step-by-step operational guide"
  - name: incident
    base: episodic
    description: "Production incident record"
```

When using ontology-extended types, the `type` field uses the base type, while specific categorization is expressed through the namespace:

```yaml
---
type: semantic
namespace: _semantic/decisions
ontology:
  id: mif-base
---
```

This allows ontologies to define rich taxonomies while maintaining interoperability through the base type foundation.

### 4.3 Ontology Reference

A Memory Unit MAY declare which ontology it conforms to using the `ontology` field:

| Property | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | REQUIRED | String | Ontology identifier (matches `ontology.id` in ontology definition) |
| `version` | OPTIONAL | String | Semantic version (e.g., "1.0.0") |
| `uri` | OPTIONAL | URI | URL to the ontology definition file |

#### Example

```yaml
ontology:
  id: regenerative-agriculture
  version: "1.0.0"
  uri: https://github.com/modeled-information-format/MIF/ontologies/examples/regenerative-agriculture.ontology.yaml
```

The `ontology.id` MUST match the `ontology.id` field in the referenced ontology definition file. This enables:

- Validation that namespace paths conform to the ontology's defined namespaces
- Discovery pattern matching for entity type suggestions
- Schema validation for entity-specific fields

### 4.4 Categorizing Memories (Fact, Event, and Beyond)

Common categories such as **Fact** and **Event** are already expressible with the
fields defined above; MIF therefore does **not** define a separate flat
`category` field. Domain categories are composed from two orthogonal axes that a
memory unit can declare directly:

1. **`type`** (REQUIRED, see 4.2) — the cognitive memory type: `semantic`,
   `episodic`, or `procedural`.
2. **`namespace`** (RECOMMENDED, see 10) — hierarchical scope that carries the
   finer-grained label (e.g. `_semantic/knowledge`, `_episodic/sessions`).

A memory unit has no field to name an ontology-extended type directly. Instead,
**ontologies define extended types and their namespace mappings** (OPTIONAL, see
4.2.1 and 10.8): an ontology declares each extended type as an `entity_types`
entry with a `base` type, and implementations express that extended type by
following the referenced ontology's namespace hierarchy on the `namespace` axis
above (e.g. an `incident` extended type whose `base` is `episodic`, reached via
`_episodic/incidents`). The extended type is therefore a richer label *on* the
namespace axis, not a separate third axis the unit declares.

> **Note on namespace form.** Base-type roots use the underscore-prefixed form
> (`_semantic`, `_episodic`, `_procedural`); these are reserved base-type
> prefixes (see 10.2), distinct from the visibility prefixes (`_public`,
> `_shared`, `_local`, `_system`) defined alongside them. Where an ontology is
> referenced, follow the namespace hierarchy it declares; the examples below
> omit ontology binding for clarity.

A **Fact** is a `semantic` memory — declarative knowledge that holds independently
of any single moment:

```yaml
---
type: semantic
namespace: _semantic/knowledge
---
```

An **Event** is an `episodic` memory — something that happened. Events MAY
carry `temporal` validity to bound when they hold (see 9):

```yaml
---
type: episodic
namespace: _episodic/sessions
temporal:
  validFrom: 2026-01-15T00:00:00Z
  validUntil: 2026-01-15T11:00:00Z
---
```

Finer distinctions are added through the namespace (e.g. `_episodic/incidents`),
whose path MAY map to an ontology-extended type defined by a referenced ontology
(e.g. an `incident` whose `base` is `episodic`) — not through a new unit-level
field. Implementations SHOULD express domain categories through `type` +
`namespace` (the namespace path mapping to an ontology-extended type where the
referenced ontology defines one) rather than
introducing a separate flat `category` (or `memoryCategory`) field: such a field
would duplicate the `type` taxonomy, fork it across implementations, and break
the interoperability the base types provide.

> **Note.** The entity types in 7 (Person, Organization, …) classify the
> entities a memory *references* via its `entities` array; they are a distinct
> axis and do not categorize the memory itself.

### 5.3 Relationship Syntax

Typed relationships are authoritative in the frontmatter `relationships[]` array and mirrored in the body as standard markdown links under a `## Relationships` section, one per line:

```markdown
## Relationships

- relates-to [Other Memory](/semantic/other-memory.md)
- derived-from [Source Incident](/episodic/source-incident.md)
- supersedes [Old Policy](/semantic/old-policy.md)
```

Each line is `- <type> [Text](<target>)`, where `<type>` is a kebab-case relationship type and `<target>` is a bundle-relative path to the target concept or a `urn:mif:` identifier (see 8). Entity references are declared in the frontmatter `entities[]` array (see 7.5).

### 5.4 Citations (Level 3)

Citations provide structured references to external sources that inform, support, or relate to the memory content. Citations are a Level 3 (Full) optional feature.

    name: Jane Smith
  - "@type": EntityReference
    entity: { "@id": urn:mif:entity:organization:anthropic }
    entityType: Organization
    name: Anthropic
```

#### 5.4.7 Citation Validation

Implementations SHOULD validate citations according to these rules:

##### Required Field Constraints

| Field | Constraint |
| --- | --- |
| `@type` | MUST be `Citation` |
| `citationType` | MUST be a value from Section 5.4.3 or a custom namespaced type (e.g., `acme:memo`) |
| `title` | MUST be a non-empty string |
| `url` | MUST be a valid URI (http, https, or custom schemes) |
| `citationRole` | MUST be a value from Section 5.4.4 or a custom namespaced role (e.g., `legal:precedent`) |

##### Optional Field Constraints

| Field | Constraint |
| --- | --- |
| `author` | SHOULD be an `EntityReference` (or array of them) or plain text |
| `date` | MUST be ISO 8601 date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `accessed` | MUST be ISO 8601 date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `relevance` | MUST be decimal between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive |
| `note` | SHOULD be under 1000 characters; longer notes SHOULD use body section |

##### Validation Errors

| Error | Severity | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing required field | Error | Reject citation |
| Invalid `type` value | Warning | Accept with `type: "other"` fallback |
| Invalid `role` value | Warning | Accept with `role: "background"` fallback |
| Malformed URL | Error | Reject citation |
| `relevance` out of range | Warning | Clamp to 0.0-1.0 |
| Invalid date format | Warning | Accept as plain text |

### 5.6 Compression (Level 3)

Compression allows large memories to be summarized while preserving the original content. Compression is typically applied by garbage collection processes to reduce memory footprint while retaining semantic value.

#### 5.6.1 Compression Fields

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | OPTIONAL | String | Concise 2-3 sentence summary (max 500 characters) |
| `compressed_at` | OPTIONAL | DateTime | When compression was applied (ISO 8601) |

##### Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
# === OPTIONAL: Compression (Level 3) ===
summary: "User prefers dark mode for reduced eye strain during extended coding sessions. Applies to IDE, terminal, and web applications."
compressed_at: 2026-01-24T10:00:00Z
```

#### 5.6.2 Compression Criteria

Implementations MAY apply compression when memories meet these criteria:

| Condition | Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| Age AND Size | Age > 30 days AND content > 100 lines |
| Decay AND Size | Strength `< 0.3` AND content > 100 lines |

#### 5.6.3 Compression Behavior

- The `content` field SHOULD be replaced with the compressed summary
- The original `content` MAY be preserved in `extensions.original_content`
- The `summary` field contains the generated summary text
- The `compressed_at` timestamp indicates when compression occurred
- Compressed memories retain all other metadata (relationships, entities, etc.)

#### 5.6.4 Compression Validation

| Field | Constraint |
| --- | --- |
| `summary` | MUST be 500 characters or fewer |
| `compressed_at` | MUST be ISO 8601 datetime format |

## 6. JSON-LD Projection (derived)

> **Markdown is canonical (Invariant 2).** The JSON-LD form below is a *derived*
> projection: regenerate it from the `.md` source with `scripts/mif_convert.py`.
> It MUST NOT use the `.md` extension (so OKF's `*.md` glob never ingests it) and
> MUST round-trip losslessly back to markdown. If the two disagree, markdown wins.

## 7. Entity Types

MIF provides an **extensible entity type system**. Implementations SHOULD support the core types for interoperability, but MAY define custom types for domain-specific needs.

### 7.1 Entity Type Architecture

Entity types are **not hard-coded**. They are defined in bundle configuration and can be extended per-project:

```yaml
# .mif/config.yaml
entity_types:
  # Core types (RECOMMENDED for interoperability)
  - name: Person
    description: Human individual
    icon: 👤
    color: blue
  - name: Organization
    description: Company, team, or group
    icon: 🏢
    color: purple
  - name: Technology
    description: Tool, language, or framework
    icon: 🔧
    color: green
  - name: Concept
    description: Abstract idea or topic
    icon: 💡
    color: yellow
  - name: File
    description: Document or code file
    icon: 📄
    color: gray

  # Custom types (domain-specific)
  - name: Project
    description: Work initiative or product
    icon: 📦
    color: orange
  - name: Event
    description: Meeting, deadline, or occurrence
    icon: 📅
    color: red
  - name: Location
    description: Physical or virtual place
    icon: 📍
    color: teal
```

### 7.2 Core Entity Types (Recommended)

For maximum interoperability, implementations SHOULD recognize these five core types:

| Type | Description | Example | URI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Person` | Human individual | User, team member | `mif:Person` |
| `Organization` | Company, team, or group | Acme Corp | `mif:Organization` |
| `Technology` | Tool, language, or framework | Python, React | `mif:Technology` |
| `Concept` | Abstract idea or topic | Dark Mode | `mif:Concept` |
| `File` | Document or code file | src/main.py | `mif:File` |

### 7.3 Custom Entity Types

Providers MAY define additional entity types using namespaced URIs:

```yaml
# Custom type definition
entity_types:
  - name: Animal
    namespace: farm        # Results in URI: farm:Animal
    description: Livestock or pet
    properties:
      - name: breed
        type: string
      - name: birth_date
        type: date
      - name: registry_id
        type: string
```

#### JSON-LD representation of custom types

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://mif-spec.dev/schema/context.jsonld",
    {"farm": "https://example.org/farm/"}
  ],
  "@type": "farm:Animal",
  "@id": "urn:mif:entity:animal:sheep-001",
  "name": "Dolly",
  "farm:breed": "Dorper",
  "farm:birth_date": "2025-03-15"
}
```

### 7.4 Entity Schema

**Markdown (in `.mif/entities/` directory):**

```yaml
# .mif/entities/person/jane-doe.yaml
id: jane-doe
type: Person
name: Jane Doe
aliases:
  - J. Doe
  - jdoe
properties:
  email: jane@example.com
  role: Engineer
```

#### JSON-LD

```json
{
  "@context": "https://mif-spec.dev/schema/context.jsonld",
  "@type": "Person",
  "@id": "urn:mif:entity:person:jane-doe",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "aliases": ["J. Doe", "jdoe"],
  "properties": {
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "role": "Engineer"
  }
}
```

### 7.5 Entity References in Memories

Entity references are declared in the frontmatter `entities[]` array as `EntityReference` objects.

#### Frontmatter

```yaml
entities:
  - "@type": EntityReference
    entity: { "@id": urn:mif:entity:person:jane-doe }
    entityType: Person
    name: Jane Doe
    role: mentions
  - "@type": EntityReference
    entity: { "@id": urn:mif:entity:technology:python }
    entityType: Technology
    name: Python
    role: uses
```

#### JSON-LD

```json
"entities": [
  {
    "@type": "EntityReference",
    "entity": {"@id": "urn:mif:entity:person:jane-doe"},
    "role": "mentions"
  }
]
```

---

## 8. Relationship Types

MIF provides an **extensible relationship type system**. Implementations SHOULD support the core types for interoperability, but MAY define custom relationship types for domain-specific needs.

### 8.1 Relationship Type Architecture

Relationship types are **not hard-coded**. They are defined in bundle configuration and can be extended per-project:

```yaml
# .mif/config.yaml
relationship_types:
  # Core types (RECOMMENDED for interoperability)
  - name: RelatesTo
    description: General semantic relationship
    symmetric: true
    icon: 🔗
  - name: DerivedFrom
    description: Memory created based on source
    inverse: Derives
    icon: ⬅️
  - name: Supersedes
    description: Replaces an older memory
    inverse: SupersededBy
    icon: ⏫
  - name: ConflictsWith
    description: Contradicts another memory
    symmetric: true
    icon: ⚠️
  - name: PartOf
    description: Component of a larger whole
    inverse: Contains
    icon: 🧩
  - name: Implements
    description: Realizes a concept or pattern
    inverse: ImplementedBy
    icon: ✅
  - name: Uses
    description: Utilizes a technology or tool
    inverse: UsedBy
    icon: 🔧
  - name: Created
    description: Authored by an entity
    inverse: CreatedBy
    icon: ✍️
  - name: MentionedIn
    description: Referenced within a memory
    inverse: Mentions
    icon: 📎

  # Custom types (domain-specific)
  - name: Reinforces
    namespace: subcog
    description: Strengthens confidence in another memory
    inverse: ReinforcedBy
    icon: 💪
  - name: Contradicts
    namespace: subcog
    description: Provides evidence against another memory
    inverse: ContradictedBy
    icon: ❌
  - name: BreedsWith
    namespace: farm
    description: Animal breeding relationship
    symmetric: false
    properties:
      - name: breeding_date
        type: date
      - name: success
        type: boolean
```

### 8.2 Core Relationship Types (Recommended)

For maximum interoperability, implementations SHOULD recognize these nine core types:

| Type | Description | Inverse | Symmetric |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RelatesTo` | General relationship | `RelatesTo` | Yes |
| `DerivedFrom` | Created based on source | `Derives` | No |
| `Supersedes` | Replaces older memory | `SupersededBy` | No |
| `ConflictsWith` | Contradicts another memory | `ConflictsWith` | Yes |
| `PartOf` | Component of larger whole | `Contains` | No |
| `Implements` | Realizes a concept/pattern | `ImplementedBy` | No |
| `Uses` | Utilizes a technology/tool | `UsedBy` | No |
| `Created` | Authored by entity | `CreatedBy` | No |
| `MentionedIn` | Referenced in memory | `Mentions` | No |

### 8.3 Custom Relationship Types

Providers MAY define additional relationship types using namespaced URIs:

```yaml
# Custom relationship type definition
relationship_types:
  - name: Contradicts
    namespace: farm           # Results in URI: farm:Contradicts
    description: Provides conflicting evidence
    inverse: ContradictedBy
    properties:
      - name: contradiction_type
        type: string
        enum: [direct, indirect, partial]
      - name: severity
        type: decimal
        range: [0.0, 1.0]
```

#### JSON-LD representation of custom relationship types

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://mif-spec.dev/schema/context.jsonld",
    {"farm": "https://example.org/farm/"}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "type": "farm:breeds-with",
      "target": "urn:mif:entity:animal:ram-001",
      "strength": 1.0,
      "metadata": {
        "farm:breeding_date": "2025-10-15",
        "farm:success": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 8.4 Relationship Schema

#### Markdown syntax

Relationships are mirrored in the body as standard markdown links under a `## Relationships` section:

```markdown
## Relationships

- relates-to [Other Memory](/semantic/other-memory.md)
- derived-from [Source Memory](/episodic/source-memory.md)
- supersedes [Old Memory](/semantic/old-memory.md)
- conflicts-with [Contradicting Memory](/semantic/contradicting-memory.md)
- part-of [Parent Memory](/semantic/parent-memory.md)
```

Each line is `- <type> [Text](<target>)`. The type is a kebab-case token; the target is a bundle-relative path to the target concept or a `urn:mif:` identifier. The frontmatter `relationships[]` array is authoritative; the body links are its OKF-legible mirror.

#### JSON-LD schema

```json
"relationships": [
  {
    "type": "derived-from",
    "target": "urn:mif:memory:source-memory",
    "strength": 0.9,
    "metadata": {
      "reason": "Extracted key insight",
      "extractedAt": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
]
```

### 8.5 Relationship Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | String | Yes | Type identifier (kebab-case; optional `ns:` prefix) |
| `target` | URI Reference | Yes | Target memory or entity URI |
| `strength` | Decimal | No | Relationship strength (0.0-1.0) |
| `metadata` | Object | No | Additional relationship metadata |

---

## 9. Temporal Model

MIF uses a bi-temporal model distinguishing between:

1. **Transaction Time**: When the memory was recorded in the system
2. **Valid Time**: When the fact represented by the memory is true

### 9.1 Temporal Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `validFrom` | DateTime | When fact becomes valid |
| `validUntil` | DateTime | When fact expires (null = indefinite) |
| `recordedAt` | DateTime | When recorded (transaction time) |
| `ttl` | Duration | Time-to-live (ISO 8601 duration) |
| `decay` | Object | Decay model parameters |
| `accessCount` | Integer | Times accessed |
| `lastAccessed` | DateTime | Last access time |

### 9.2 Decay Models

| Model | Formula | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | No decay | Permanent memories |
| `linear` | strength = 1 - (t / ttl) | Simple linear decay |
| `exponential` | strength = e^(-t/halfLife) | Gradual freshness decay |
| `step` | strength = 1 if t < ttl else 0 | Hard expiration |

### 9.3 Freshness Rationale

In the core model, the temporal decay function expresses **freshness** — how
current a piece of knowledge is — and answers OKF's open "live vs. stale"
question. The decay half-life defaults (P7D, P14D, P30D) are **pragmatic
defaults** for how quickly knowledge of a given kind loses currency; they are
not prescriptive.

The `strength = e^(-t/halfLife)` curve models a value that is fully current when
recorded and decays gradually toward stale, with `validFrom`/`validUntil`
windows bounding the interval in which a fact is asserted to hold.

#### Why These Specific Values?

| Half-Life | Use Case | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P7D** | Short-term context | Aligns with weekly work cycles |
| **P14D** | Medium-term projects | Spans typical sprint/iteration boundaries |
| **P30D** | Long-term knowledge | Corresponds to monthly review cycles |
| **P90D** | Default TTL | Quarterly relevance for most organizational knowledge |

Implementations SHOULD tune these based on:

- Knowledge kind (`episodic` records go stale faster than `semantic` facts)
- Organizational context (high-velocity vs. stable environments)
- Access patterns (frequently accessed knowledge can reinforce slower decay)

The `lastAccessed` and `accessCount` fields let implementations model
reinforcement — each access can reset or slow the freshness decay.

> **Cognitive-memory origin.** This exponential curve originates in the
> cognitive-science account of human memory decay. That rationale — including
> the underlying experimental references and decay tuning for retrieval-oriented
> systems — now lives in the **AI Memory profile**
> (`profiles/ai-memory/SPECIFICATION.md`), keeping the core framed purely as
> freshness.

### 9.4 Example

```yaml
temporal:
  validFrom: 2026-01-15T00:00:00Z
  validUntil: null
  recordedAt: 2026-01-15T10:30:00Z
  ttl: P90D
  decay:
    model: exponential
    halfLife: P7D
    strength: 0.85
    lastReinforced: 2026-01-18T09:00:00Z
  accessCount: 5
  lastAccessed: 2026-01-20T14:22:00Z
```

## 10. Namespace Model

### 10.1 Namespace Structure

Namespaces use a flexible scoping model with reserved prefixes for cross-organization sharing:

```text
{root}/{scope}+[/{session}]
```

Where `{root}` is either:

- **Organization name** - private to that organization
- **Reserved prefix** - special namespace with defined semantics. Two kinds of
  reserved prefixes exist (both begin with `_`): **visibility prefixes** that
  control sharing scope, and **base-type prefixes** that name the cognitive
  memory type. Both are defined in 10.2.

### 10.2 Reserved Namespace Prefixes

Names beginning with underscore (`_`) are reserved for special namespaces. Two
kinds exist: **visibility prefixes** that control sharing scope, and
**base-type prefixes** that name the cognitive memory type.

#### Visibility Prefixes

| Prefix | Visibility | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_public` | Global | Publicly accessible by anyone |
| `_shared` | Negotiated | Cross-organization sharing with explicit agreements |
| `_local` | Local only | Never synchronized or exported |
| `_system` | Implementation | Reserved for system/implementation use |

#### Base-Type Prefixes

Namespace paths use an underscore prefix (`_semantic`, `_episodic`,
`_procedural`) to distinguish base-type namespaces from domain-specific
namespaces. This convention ensures consistent namespace identification across
implementations. Each base-type prefix corresponds to a base memory `type`
(see 4.2) and is the top-level root of the base ontology's namespace hierarchy
(see 10.8.2).

| Prefix | Base type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_semantic` | `semantic` | Facts, concepts, relationships - declarative knowledge |
| `_episodic` | `episodic` | Events, experiences, timelines - time-bound records |
| `_procedural` | `procedural` | Step-by-step processes - how-to knowledge |

#### Examples

```text
# Public knowledge (globally accessible)
_public/python/async-patterns
_public/react/hooks-best-practices
_public/security/owasp-top-10

# Shared between organizations (requires agreement)
_shared/cncf/kubernetes/patterns           # CNCF member consortium
_shared/acme+bigcorp/integration-api       # Bilateral agreement
_shared/industry-healthcare/hipaa-compliance

# Organization-private (default)
acme-corp/jane-doe/preferences
acme-corp/project-x/architecture-decisions
acme-corp/team-frontend/patterns
```

### 10.3 Flexible Scopes Within Organizations

Within an organization, scopes are **peer-level** - users, projects, teams, and other organizational units are treated equally:

```text
{organization}/{scope}+

Examples:
- acme-corp/jane-doe                    # user scope
- acme-corp/project-x                   # project scope
- acme-corp/team-frontend               # team scope
- acme-corp/jane-doe/project-x          # user + project (order flexible)
- acme-corp/project-x/jane-doe          # same as above
- acme-corp/team-frontend/project-x     # team + project
```

**Key principle:** Within an organization, there is no enforced hierarchy between users, projects, or teams. The path segments represent scope intersection, not parent-child relationships.

### 10.4 Shared Namespace Agreements

The `_shared` prefix requires explicit agreements between organizations:

```yaml
# .mif/shared-agreements/acme+bigcorp.yaml
id: acme+bigcorp
type: bilateral
parties:
  - acme-corp
  - bigcorp-inc
created: 2026-01-15T00:00:00Z
namespaces:
  - _shared/acme+bigcorp/integration-api
  - _shared/acme+bigcorp/data-formats
access:
  read: [acme-corp, bigcorp-inc]
  write: [acme-corp, bigcorp-inc]
```

For consortiums or communities:

```yaml
# .mif/shared-agreements/cncf.yaml
id: cncf
type: consortium
admin: cncf-foundation
members:
  - google
  - microsoft
  - redhat
  # ... (member list or reference)
namespaces:
  - _shared/cncf/*
access:
  read: members
  write: approved-contributors
```

### 10.5 Custom Reserved Prefixes

Implementations MAY define additional reserved prefixes following the underscore convention:

```yaml
# .mif/config.yaml
reserved_prefixes:
  _archive:
    description: Archived memories (read-only)
    access: read-only
  _experimental:
    description: Experimental/unstable memories
    ttl: P30D
  _imported:
    description: Memories imported from external systems
    provenance_required: true
```

### 10.6 Namespace URIs

Full URI form for cross-system references:

```text
mif://{domain}/{namespace}/{memory-id}
```

Examples:

- `mif://github.com/modeled-information-format/acme-corp/project-x/550e8400...`
- `mif://registry/_public/python/async-patterns/abc123...`
- `mif://local/_local/scratch/memory-123`

### 10.7 Namespace Inheritance

Child namespaces MAY inherit properties from parents:

```yaml
# .mif/namespaces/acme-corp.yaml
id: acme-corp
type: organization
default_ttl: P365D
default_visibility: private

# .mif/namespaces/acme-corp/project-x.yaml
id: project-x
parent: acme-corp
default_tags: [project-x]
# Inherits default_ttl and default_visibility from parent
```

### 10.8 Ontology Definition

Ontologies define namespace hierarchies, entity types, and discovery patterns.
They enable domain-specific customization while maintaining MIF compatibility.

#### 10.8.1 Ontology Files

Ontologies are defined in YAML files with optional JSON-LD export:

```text
.mif/ontologies/
├── mif-base.ontology.yaml       # Base ontology (semantic/episodic/procedural)
├── mif-base.ontology.jsonld     # JSON-LD export for semantic web
└── domain/
    └── software-engineering.ontology.yaml
```

#### 10.8.2 Base Type Hierarchy

The base ontology uses a three-tier hierarchy based on cognitive memory types.
Its three top-level roots are the base-type prefixes defined in 10.2:

```yaml
namespaces:
  _semantic:                   # Facts, concepts, relationships
    type_hint: semantic
    children:
      decisions: {}
      knowledge: {}
      entities: {}
  _episodic:                   # Events, experiences, timelines

```

#### 10.8.3 Entity Type Definition

Entity types define structured data with traits and JSON Schema:

```yaml
entity_types:
  - name: component
    base: semantic
    traits: [versioned, documented]
    schema:
      required: [name, responsibility]
      properties:
        name: { type: string }
        responsibility: { type: string }
        dependencies: { type: array, items: { type: string } }
```

#### 10.8.4 Discovery Patterns

Ontologies can define patterns for suggesting entity types:

```yaml
discovery:
  enabled: true
  confidence_threshold: 0.8
  patterns:
    - content_pattern: "\\b(PostgreSQL|MySQL|MongoDB)\\b"
      suggest_entity: technology
      suggest_namespace: _semantic/entities
    - file_pattern: "**/services/**/*.py"
      suggest_entity: component
      suggest_namespace: _semantic/components
```

#### 10.8.5 Ontology Resolution

Ontologies are loaded from multiple sources with precedence:

1. MIF base ontology (built-in)
2. User ontology (`${MNEMONIC_ROOT}/ontology.yaml`)
3. Project ontology (`./.claude/mnemonic/ontology.yaml`)

Later sources can extend or override earlier definitions.

#### 10.8.6 Trait Inheritance and Conflict Resolution

Traits support inheritance via the `extends` field, enabling composition:

```yaml
traits:
  timestamped:
    fields:
      created: { type: string, format: date-time }
      modified: { type: string, format: date-time }

  auditable:
    extends: [timestamped]
    fields:
      audit_log: { type: array }
      last_audited: { type: string, format: date-time }

  lifecycle:
    extends: [timestamped]
    fields:
      status: { type: string, enum: [draft, active, archived] }
```

##### Conflict Resolution Strategy

When multiple traits define the same field (e.g., both `auditable` and `lifecycle` inherit `created` from `timestamped`), implementations MUST apply the following resolution rules:

| Scenario | Resolution | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same field inherited via different paths | Use shared ancestor definition | Diamond inheritance resolved to common base |
| Same field defined in multiple independent traits | Error at composition time | Ambiguous definition requires explicit resolution |
| Field in trait overrides inherited field | Child definition wins | Explicit override is intentional |
| Field in entity overrides trait field | Entity definition wins | Most specific wins |

##### Example - Diamond Inheritance

```yaml
# Both auditable and lifecycle inherit timestamped
entity_types:
  - name: document
    traits: [auditable, lifecycle]  # No conflict: `created` from shared `timestamped`
```

##### Example - Conflict Requiring Resolution

```yaml
traits:
  trait_a:
    fields:
      status: { type: string, enum: [open, closed] }

  trait_b:
    fields:
      status: { type: string, enum: [draft, published] }

entity_types:
  - name: conflicting_entity
    traits: [trait_a, trait_b]
    # ERROR: `status` defined differently in both traits
    # Resolution: Override explicitly in entity schema
    schema:
      properties:
        status: { type: string, enum: [draft, open, published, closed] }
```

##### Implementation Guidance

1. **Validation**: Implementations SHOULD detect conflicts at ontology load time
2. **Error Messages**: Include both conflicting definitions and their sources
3. **Explicit Override**: When conflicts exist, entity-level schema takes precedence
4. **Documentation**: Ontology authors SHOULD document intentional overrides

---

## 11. Embedding References

### 11.1 Model-Agnostic Approach

MIF stores embedding metadata, not raw vectors:

```yaml
embedding:
  model: text-embedding-3-small
  modelVersion: "2024-01"
  dimensions: 1536
  sourceText: "The text that was embedded"
  normalized: true
  quantization: null  # or "float16", "int8"
```

This allows:

- Re-embedding on import with different models
- Smaller file sizes
- Model migration without data loss

### 11.2 Optional Vector Storage

For providers that need vector portability:

#### External Reference

```yaml
embedding:
  model: text-embedding-3-small
  sourceText: "..."
  vectorUri: "urn:mif:vector:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
```

#### Inline (JSON-LD only)

```json
"embedding": {
  "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
  "sourceText": "...",
  "vector": {
    "@type": "Vector",
    "encoding": "base64-float32",
    "data": "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh..."
  }
}
```

## 12. Provenance

MIF provenance has two layers. The **core** is a lightweight, always-available
set of fields — `sourceType`, `confidence`, `trustLevel`, plus optional
`sourceRef` / `agent` / `agentVersion` — that captures how a unit came to exist
and how much to trust it. Layered on top is an **optional W3C-PROV-aligned** set
of fields (`wasGeneratedBy`, `wasAttributedTo`, `wasDerivedFrom`) that lets a
unit carry a real PROV entity/activity/agent lineage when richer provenance is
needed. The entity/activity/agent roles are expressed through the `@type`
values (`prov:Entity`, `prov:Activity`, `prov:SoftwareAgent`) on the provenance
object and its nested nodes.

Both layers are OPTIONAL and additive: a conforming unit MAY omit provenance
entirely, MAY use only the lightweight core, or MAY include the PROV-aligned
fields. The PROV fields project to the W3C PROV vocabulary (`prov:`) through the
JSON-LD context, so a full PROV graph is expressible but never required.

### 12.1 Source Types

| Type | Description | Confidence Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user_explicit` | User directly stated | 0.90 - 1.00 |
| `user_implicit` | Inferred from user actions | 0.70 - 0.89 |
| `agent_inferred` | AI reasoning from context | 0.50 - 0.69 |
| `external_import` | From external data source | 0.30 - 0.70 |
| `system_generated` | Automatically generated | 0.20 - 0.50 |

### 12.2 Trust Levels

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `verified` | Confirmed by multiple sources |
| `user_stated` | User explicitly provided |
| `high_confidence` | Strong inference |
| `moderate_confidence` | Reasonable inference |
| `low_confidence` | Weak inference |
| `uncertain` | Unverified |

### 12.3 Provenance Schema

The lightweight core (all fields here are OPTIONAL within an OPTIONAL block):

```yaml
provenance:
  sourceType: user_explicit                 # how the unit was created
  sourceRef: conversation:conv-456          # reference to the originating source
  agent: claude-3-opus                      # creating agent
  agentVersion: "20240229"                  # creating-agent version
  confidence: 0.95                          # confidence score (0-1)
  trustLevel: user_stated                   # trust classification
```

To attach a W3C-PROV-aligned lineage, add the OPTIONAL PROV fields. Keys stay
plain (no `prov:` prefix) and are mapped to the W3C PROV vocabulary by the
JSON-LD context; the `@type` values use the `prov:` prefix:

```yaml
provenance:
  '@type': prov:Entity
  sourceType: user_explicit
  confidence: 0.95
  trustLevel: user_stated
  wasGeneratedBy:                           # prov:wasGeneratedBy
    '@id': urn:mif:activity:extraction:mem-001
    '@type': prov:Activity
    wasAssociatedWith:                      # prov:wasAssociatedWith
      '@id': urn:mif:agent:claude-3-opus
      '@type': prov:SoftwareAgent
  wasAttributedTo:                          # prov:wasAttributedTo
    '@id': urn:mif:entity:person:jane-doe
  wasDerivedFrom:                           # prov:wasDerivedFrom
    '@id': urn:mif:conversation:conv-456
```

## 13. Conformance Levels

### 13.1 Level 1: Core (REQUIRED for conformance)

- `id`, `type`, `content`, `created` fields
- Valid Markdown or JSON-LD structure
- Standard markdown-link relationship syntax

### 13.2 Level 2: Standard (RECOMMENDED)

- All Level 1 requirements
- Namespace support
- Entity references
- Relationship types
- Temporal metadata (timestamps)

### 13.3 Level 3: Full (OPTIONAL)

- All Level 2 requirements
- Bi-temporal model
- Decay functions
- Optional W3C-PROV-aligned provenance layer
- Embedding references
- Citations with rich metadata
- Compression support
- Extension support

### 13.4 Conformance Statement

Implementations SHOULD declare their conformance level:

```yaml
# .mif/config.yaml
mif_version: "1.0.0"
conformance_level: 2
extensions:
  - subcog
  - custom-provider
```

---

## 14. JSON-LD Context

### 14.1 Context URL

```text
https://mif-spec.dev/schema/context.jsonld
```

### 14.2 Context Definition

The canonical JSON-LD context is maintained in `schema/context.jsonld` at the
root of this repository and is served at:

```text
https://mif-spec.dev/schema/context.jsonld
```

That file defines the JSON-LD term mappings for MIF documents. Implementations
MUST dereference the context URL rather than inlining a local copy. The context
is versioned alongside the schema; breaking changes to term mappings require a
new major version of the specification.

---

## 15. Conversion Rules

### 15.1 Markdown to JSON-LD

1. Parse YAML frontmatter as structured data (including `relationships[]` and `entities[]`)
2. Map frontmatter properties to JSON-LD using context
3. Parse the body `## Relationships` section: each `- <type> [Text](<target>)` line maps to a `relationships` entry (reconciled with the authoritative frontmatter array)
4. Convert body content to `content` field

### 15.2 JSON-LD to Markdown

1. Generate YAML frontmatter from JSON-LD properties (including `relationships[]` and `entities[]`)
2. Set first `title` or H1 from `dc:title`
3. Convert `content` to Markdown body
4. Append a "## Relationships" section, rendering each relationship as `- <type> [Text](<target>)`

### 15.3 Example Conversion

#### Input (JSON-LD)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://mif-spec.dev/schema/context.jsonld",
  "@type": "Concept",
  "@id": "urn:mif:550e8400",
  "title": "Dark Mode",
  "content": "User prefers dark mode",
  "relationships": [
    {"type": "relates-to", "target": "urn:mif:ui-prefs"}
  ]
}
```

#### Output (Markdown)

```markdown
---
id: 550e8400
type: semantic
title: Dark Mode
---

# Dark Mode

User prefers dark mode

## Relationships

- relates-to [ui-prefs](urn:mif:ui-prefs)
```

### 15.4 Citations Conversion

#### Markdown to JSON-LD

1. Parse the frontmatter `citations` array. Each entry is already a `Citation`
   object authored in its final shape (`@type: Citation`, `citationType`,
   `citationRole`, `title`, `url`, ...).
2. Pass each citation through to the JSON-LD projection verbatim — the converter
   performs no field renaming. Author values are preserved as written (plain
   text or an `EntityReference`).
3. Any `## Citations` body section is authored content carried inside `content`;
   the frontmatter `citations` array remains authoritative.

#### JSON-LD to Markdown

1. Generate frontmatter `citations` array from JSON-LD
2. Convert entity URIs to `EntityReference` objects
3. If any citation has `note` exceeding 100 characters:
   - Create `## Citations` body section
   - Format as markdown list with metadata

#### Example

```yaml
# Frontmatter
citations:
  - "@type": Citation
    citationType: article
    title: "Research Paper"
    url: https://example.com/paper
    citationRole: supports
    author:
      "@type": EntityReference
      entity: { "@id": urn:mif:entity:person:jane-smith }
      entityType: Person
      name: Jane Smith
```

Converts to:

```json
"citations": [{
  "@type": "Citation",
  "citationType": "article",
  "citationRole": "supports",
  "title": "Research Paper",
  "url": "https://example.com/paper",
  "author": {
    "@type": "EntityReference",
    "entity": {"@id": "urn:mif:entity:person:jane-smith"}
  }
}]
```

# Use React over Vue for the dashboard

## Context

We need to choose a frontend framework for the new dashboard.

## Decision

We will use React because:
- Team has more React experience
- Better TypeScript integration
- Larger ecosystem for our needs

## Consequences

- Need to set up Create React App or Vite
- Will use React Query for data fetching
- Component library: Radix UI

## Relationships

- relates-to [Frontend Architecture](/semantic/frontend-architecture.md)
- supersedes [Vue Exploration](/semantic/vue-exploration.md)
```

### 16.3 Full Memory (Level 3)

See Section 6.2 for a complete Level 3 example.

---

## 17. Migration

MIF v1.0.0 ships a complete upgrade path from `0.1.0-draft`. The mechanical
transform (drops the legacy `.memory` infix to plain `.md`, adds UUID identity, wiki-links → OKF-legible body
markdown links + frontmatter `relationships`, ISO 8601 timestamps) is automated
by `scripts/migrate_0_1_to_1_0.py` and documented in
[`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md).

System-specific migration guides for individual AI-memory providers are part
of the AI Memory profile, not the core model:
see [`profiles/ai-memory/SPECIFICATION.md`](profiles/ai-memory/SPECIFICATION.md).

## 18. Security Considerations

### 18.1 Data Privacy

- MIF files MAY contain sensitive personal information
- Implementations SHOULD support encryption at rest
- Namespace isolation SHOULD be enforced
- Export functions MUST respect access controls

### 18.2 Integrity

- Implementations SHOULD compute content hashes
- The `extensions.hash` field MAY store integrity hashes
- Import functions SHOULD verify integrity when hashes present

### 18.3 Provenance Trust

- `provenance.trustLevel` indicates data reliability
- Implementations SHOULD NOT elevate trust levels on import
- External sources SHOULD be marked as `external_import`

---

## 19. IANA Considerations

### 19.1 Media Type Registration

#### Markdown Format

- Type name: text
- Subtype name: markdown
- Required parameters: variant=mif
- Optional parameters: version

#### JSON-LD Format

- Type name: application
- Subtype name: ld+json
- Required parameters: `profile="https://mif-spec.dev"`

### 19.2 URI Scheme

MIF URIs use the `mif:` scheme:

```text
mif://{authority}/{namespace}/{memory-id}
```
