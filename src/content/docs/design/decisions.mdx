This page catalogs the architectural decision records (ADRs) that document key design choices in MIF. Each ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of a significant architectural choice.

## Decision Records

| ADR | Title | Status | Summary |
|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| ADR-001 | Cognitive Triad Taxonomy | Accepted | Adopts the cognitive triad from cognitive psychology (semantic, episodic, procedural) as the universal memory classification system, grounded in Tulving's established research. |
| ADR-002 | Dual Format Design | Accepted | Supports both Markdown and JSON-LD as first-class formats -- Markdown for human authoring and readability, JSON-LD for machine processing and semantic web integration. |
| ADR-003 | Obsidian Compatibility | Accepted | Adopts Obsidian-compatible conventions including YAML frontmatter, wiki-style links, block references, and folder-based organization for seamless knowledge management integration. |
| ADR-004 | Three-Tier Trait Inheritance | Accepted | Implements a three-tier trait inheritance model (mif-base, shared-traits, domain ontologies) for reusable, composable field definitions across ontologies. |
| ADR-005 | Underscore Namespace Prefix | Accepted | Uses underscore prefix (`_semantic/`, `_episodic/`, `_procedural/`) for base type namespaces to visually distinguish system namespaces and ensure predictable sort order. |
| ADR-006 | EntityData vs EntityReference | Accepted | Defines two distinct entity patterns: EntityReference for lightweight mentions of entities in content, and EntityData for full structured ontology-typed data embedded in memories. |
| ADR-007 | GitHub Raw URLs for Schema IDs | Accepted | Uses GitHub raw content URLs for all JSON Schema `$id` values, providing immediately resolvable, zero-cost hosted schema identifiers with natural git-based versioning. |
| ADR-008 | Decay Model Rationale | Accepted | Implements a configurable memory decay model (none, linear, exponential, step) with type-specific half-life defaults, inspired by Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve research. |

## Details

### ADR-001: Cognitive Triad Taxonomy

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-27

MIF needed a memory classification system that is universally applicable, grounded in established theory, and simple enough for practical use. The decision adopts the cognitive triad from cognitive psychology -- semantic memory (facts and knowledge), episodic memory (events and experiences), and procedural memory (skills and processes). This is based on Tulving's (1972) foundational research on memory systems. Specific sub-categorization is handled through namespace extensions rather than additional types.

### ADR-002: Dual Format Design (Markdown + JSON-LD)

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-27

MIF needs to serve both human authors and machine consumers. Rather than choosing one format, MIF supports both Markdown (with YAML frontmatter) and JSON-LD as first-class, semantically equivalent formats. Markdown provides familiar authoring and readability, while JSON-LD provides structured validation and semantic web compatibility. The two formats are bidirectionally convertible.

### ADR-003: Obsidian Compatibility

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-27

Many knowledge workers use Obsidian for personal knowledge management. MIF adopts Obsidian-compatible conventions including YAML frontmatter for metadata, wiki-style `[[links]]` for cross-references, `^block-id` references for granular citations, and folder-based organization mapped to namespaces. This enables zero-friction integration with existing Obsidian workflows while maintaining format independence.

### ADR-004: Three-Tier Trait Inheritance

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-27

MIF ontologies need reusable field definitions that can be composed into entity types without repetition. The three-tier model provides: Tier 1 (mif-base) with core traits like `timestamped` and `identified`, Tier 2 (shared-traits) with common cross-domain traits like `located` and `lifecycle`, and Tier 3 (domain ontologies) with domain-specific traits. This balances reusability with extensibility through a clear inheritance chain.

### ADR-005: Underscore Namespace Prefix Convention

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-27

The three base type namespaces (`_semantic/`, `_episodic/`, `_procedural/`) use an underscore prefix to visually distinguish them from domain-specific namespaces. This ensures they sort to the top of directory listings, remain visible in all file browsers (unlike dot-prefixed directories), and signal system-level organization. Domain sub-namespaces within these remain unprefixed.

### ADR-006: EntityData vs EntityReference

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-27

MIF represents entities in two distinct contexts: EntityReference for lightweight pointers to entities mentioned in content (using core types like Person, Organization, Technology), and EntityData for full structured data when a memory IS an entity with domain-specific fields defined by an ontology schema. Both patterns can coexist in the same memory document.

### ADR-007: GitHub Raw URLs for Schema IDs

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-27

JSON Schema `$id` values use GitHub raw content URLs (e.g., `https://mif-spec.dev/schema/mif.schema.json`) instead of custom domains or URNs. This provides immediately resolvable identifiers with zero hosting infrastructure, natural versioning via git refs, and full open-source transparency. Earlier placeholder domains (`mif.io`, `subcog.io`) were replaced as they never existed.

### ADR-008: Decay Model Rationale

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-27

AI memory systems need mechanisms to prioritize recent/relevant memories and manage storage growth. MIF implements a configurable decay model with four types (none, linear, exponential, step) and type-specific default half-lives: P30D for semantic memories, P7D for episodic, and P14D for procedural. The model is inspired by Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve and the ACT-R memory decay model, with reinforcement through access and explicit commands.
