# Memory Interchange Format

> An open standard for portable AI memory representation.

MIF defines a vendor-neutral data model for AI memories with dual
representations: human-readable Markdown files and machine-processable
JSON-LD documents. One format, every provider.

## Why MIF?

AI memory is fragmented. Mem0, Zep, Letta, LangMem, and others each use
proprietary schemas with no interoperability. Switching providers means
losing memories or writing custom migration code.

MIF fixes this.

**For memory providers**: Adopt a common interchange format. Users gain
confidence knowing their data is portable, which lowers switching costs
and raises adoption.

**For developers**: Build on a stable schema with semantic web
compatibility. MIF memories are valid JSON-LD documents that work with
existing linked data tooling.

**For users**: Own your memories. MIF files are valid Obsidian notes
that work in any Markdown editor. No cloud dependency required.

## Quick Start

A minimal MIF memory in Markdown:

```markdown
---
id: "urn:mif:memory:a1b2c3"
type: "semantic"
title: "User prefers dark mode"
confidence: 0.92
created: "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
---

The user consistently selects dark mode across all applications.
They mentioned it reduces eye strain during late-night coding sessions.

## Relationships

- relates_to: [[urn:mif:memory:ui-prefs]] "UI Preferences"
```

The same memory as JSON-LD:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://mif-spec.dev/schema/context.jsonld",
  "@type": "mif:Memory",
  "mif:id": "urn:mif:memory:a1b2c3",
  "mif:memoryType": "semantic",
  "mif:title": "User prefers dark mode",
  "mif:confidence": 0.92,
  "mif:created": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "mif:content": "The user consistently selects dark mode across all applications. They mentioned it reduces eye strain during late-night coding sessions.",
  "mif:relationships": [
    {
      "@type": "mif:Relationship",
      "mif:type": "relates_to",
      "mif:target": "urn:mif:memory:ui-prefs",
      "mif:label": "UI Preferences"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dual Format** | Human-readable `.memory.md` and machine-processable `.memory.json` |
| **Semantic Web** | JSON-LD with full linked data compatibility |
| **Obsidian Native** | Markdown files work as valid Obsidian vault notes |
| **Bi-Temporal** | Track both event time and recording time |
| **Memory Decay** | Built-in confidence decay models (exponential, step, linear) |
| **Entity System** | Typed entities: Person, Organization, Technology, Concept, File |
| **9 Relationship Types** | `relates_to`, `derived_from`, `supersedes`, `contradicts`, and more |
| **Provenance** | W3C PROV-based origin tracking |
| **Namespaces** | Hierarchical organization with reserved cognitive prefixes |
| **3 Conformance Levels** | Progressive adoption from basic to full compliance |

## Current Status

**Version**: 0.1.0-draft

This is a draft specification. No providers currently implement MIF. The
goal is to establish a vendor-neutral interchange format that providers
may choose to adopt. Feedback and contributions are welcome.
