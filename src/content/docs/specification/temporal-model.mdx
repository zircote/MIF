title: Temporal Model
description: Bi-temporal tracking and memory decay models.
---

MIF uses a bi-temporal model distinguishing between:

1. **Transaction Time**: When the memory was recorded in the system
2. **Valid Time**: When the fact represented by the memory is true

### Temporal Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `validFrom` | DateTime | When fact becomes valid |
| `validUntil` | DateTime | When fact expires (null = indefinite) |
| `recordedAt` | DateTime | When recorded (transaction time) |
| `ttl` | Duration | Time-to-live (ISO 8601 duration) |
| `decay` | Object | Decay model parameters |
| `accessCount` | Integer | Times accessed |
| `lastAccessed` | DateTime | Last access time |

### Decay Models

| Model | Formula | Use Case |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `none` | No decay | Permanent memories |
| `linear` | strength = 1 - (t / ttl) | Simple linear decay |
| `exponential` | strength = e^(-t/halfLife) | Natural forgetting curve |
| `step` | strength = 1 if t < ttl else 0 | Hard expiration |

### Decay Rationale

MIF's decay model values (P7D, P14D, P30D half-lives) are **pragmatic defaults** for AI memory systems, inspired by but not directly derived from cognitive psychology research. They represent reasonable approximations for memory management in agentic contexts.

#### Scientific Background

The exponential decay model `strength = e^(-t/halfLife)` is inspired by Hermann Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve (1885), which demonstrates that memory retention follows an exponential decline:

| Time Elapsed | Approximate Retention |
|--------------|----------------------|
| 1 hour       | ~50% |
| 24 hours     | ~30-35% |
| 7 days       | ~25% |
| 30 days      | ~10% |

The mathematical form `R = e^(-t/S)` where R is retrievability, t is time elapsed, and S is memory strength, has been validated by modern replication studies.

#### Why These Specific Values?

| Half-Life | Use Case | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **P7D** | Short-term context | Aligns with weekly work cycles and episodic memory consolidation windows |
| **P14D** | Medium-term projects | Spans typical sprint/iteration boundaries |
| **P30D** | Long-term knowledge | Corresponds to monthly review cycles and hippocampal consolidation periods (~30 days in animal studies) |
| **P90D** | Default TTL | Quarterly relevance for most organizational knowledge |

These values are **not** prescriptive—implementations SHOULD tune them based on:
- Memory type (episodic decays faster than semantic)
- Organizational context (high-velocity vs. stable environments)
- Access patterns (frequently accessed memories reinforce slower decay)

#### Memory Consolidation Considerations

Research on memory consolidation suggests memories transition from hippocampus-dependent (recent) to cortex-dependent (remote) storage over time. MIF's `lastAccessed` and `accessCount` fields enable implementations to model reinforcement—each access can reset or slow decay, analogous to spaced repetition strengthening memory traces.
