description: The nine core relationship types for connecting memories.
---

MIF provides an **extensible relationship type system**. Implementations SHOULD support the core types for interoperability, but MAY define custom relationship types for domain-specific needs.

### Relationship Type Architecture

Relationship types are **not hard-coded**. They are defined in vault configuration and can be extended per-project:

```yaml
# .mif/config.yaml
relationship_types:
  # Core types (RECOMMENDED for interoperability)
  - name: RelatesTo
    description: General semantic relationship
    symmetric: true
  - name: DerivedFrom
    description: Memory created based on source
    inverse: Derives
  - name: Supersedes
    description: Replaces an older memory
    inverse: SupersededBy
  - name: ConflictsWith
    description: Contradicts another memory
    symmetric: true
  - name: PartOf
    description: Component of a larger whole
    inverse: Contains
  - name: Implements
    description: Realizes a concept or pattern
    inverse: ImplementedBy
  - name: Uses
    description: Utilizes a technology or tool
    inverse: UsedBy
  - name: Created
    description: Authored by an entity
    inverse: CreatedBy
  - name: MentionedIn
    description: Referenced within a memory
    inverse: Mentions

  # Custom types (domain-specific)
  - name: Reinforces
    namespace: subcog
    description: Strengthens confidence in another memory
    inverse: ReinforcedBy
  - name: Contradicts
    namespace: subcog
    description: Provides evidence against another memory
    inverse: ContradictedBy
  - name: BreedsWith
    namespace: farm
    description: Animal breeding relationship
    symmetric: false
    properties:
      - name: breeding_date
        type: date
      - name: success
        type: boolean
```

### Core Relationship Types (Recommended)

For maximum interoperability, implementations SHOULD recognize these nine core types:

| Type | Description | Inverse | Symmetric |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| `RelatesTo` | General relationship | `RelatesTo` | Yes |
| `DerivedFrom` | Created based on source | `Derives` | No |
| `Supersedes` | Replaces older memory | `SupersededBy` | No |
| `ConflictsWith` | Contradicts another memory | `ConflictsWith` | Yes |
| `PartOf` | Component of larger whole | `Contains` | No |
| `Implements` | Realizes a concept/pattern | `ImplementedBy` | No |
| `Uses` | Utilizes a technology/tool | `UsedBy` | No |
| `Created` | Authored by entity | `CreatedBy` | No |
| `MentionedIn` | Referenced in memory | `Mentions` | No |

### Custom Relationship Types

Providers MAY define additional relationship types using namespaced URIs:

```yaml
# Custom relationship type definition
relationship_types:
  - name: Contradicts
    namespace: farm           # Results in URI: farm:Contradicts
    description: Provides conflicting evidence
    inverse: ContradictedBy
    properties:
      - name: contradiction_type
        type: string
        enum: [direct, indirect, partial]
      - name: severity
        type: decimal
        range: [0.0, 1.0]
```

**JSON-LD representation of custom relationship types:**

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://mif-spec.dev/schema/context.jsonld",
    {"farm": "https://example.org/farm/"}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "@type": "Relationship",
      "relationshipType": "farm:BreedsWith",
      "target": {"@id": "urn:mif:entity:animal:ram-001"},
      "strength": 1.0,
      "farm:breeding_date": "2025-10-15",
      "farm:success": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Relationship Schema

**Markdown syntax:**

Relationships use a simple `type [[target]]` format in a dedicated section:

```markdown
## Relationships

- relates-to [[Other Memory]]
- derived-from [[Source Memory]]
- supersedes [[Old Memory]]
- conflicts-with [[Contradicting Memory]]
- part-of [[Parent Memory]]
```

The relationship type name is converted to kebab-case in Markdown. The target uses wiki-link syntax `[[]]` which resolves to the memory's `@id` or title.

**JSON-LD schema:**

```json
"relationships": [
  {
    "@type": "Relationship",
    "relationshipType": "DerivedFrom",
    "target": {"@id": "urn:mif:memory:source-memory"},
    "strength": 0.9,
    "metadata": {
      "reason": "Extracted key insight",
      "extractedAt": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
]
```

### Relationship Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `@type` | String | Yes | Always `"Relationship"` |
| `relationshipType` | URI/Vocab | Yes | Type identifier (core or custom) |
| `target` | URI Reference | Yes | Target memory or entity URI |
| `strength` | Decimal | No | Relationship strength (0.0-1.0) |
| `metadata` | Object | No | Additional relationship metadata |
