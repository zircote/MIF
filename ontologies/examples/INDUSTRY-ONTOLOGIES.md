# Industry Ontologies for MIF

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the four industry
ontologies created for the Memory Interchange Format (MIF) system.

## Overview

Four domain-specific ontologies demonstrate how to extend the MIF base
ontology for different industries:

| Ontology | Domain | Entity Types | Traits Used |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `regenerative-agriculture` | Farm operations | 17 | 12 |
| `k12-educational-publishing` | Educational content | 16 | 10 |
| `biology-research-lab` | Academic research | 18 | 11 |
| `backstage` | Developer portals | 12 | 6 |

All four ontologies:
- Extend `mif-base.ontology.yaml` (base type namespaces)
- Use traits from `shared-traits.ontology.yaml` (DRY mixins)
- Follow the MIF schema specification v2
- Include discovery patterns for entity suggestion

---

## Regenerative Agriculture Ontology

### Purpose

Models regenerative farm operations with full ecosystem coverage including
supply chain integration, carbon credit markets, and certification bodies.

### Research Sources

| Source | URL | Relevance |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Rodale Institute ROC Standards | https://rodaleinstitute.org | Certification tiers |
| Soil & Climate Initiative v3.0 | https://soilclimateinitiative.org | Verification framework |
| USDA NRCS Soil Health | https://www.nrcs.usda.gov | Core principles |
| Rainforest Alliance (2025) | https://rainforest-alliance.org | Regen ag standard |
| FoodChain ID RGN Standard | https://foodchainid.com | Tiered certification |
| FAO Agroecology Hub | https://www.fao.org | Global standards |

### Design Rationale

**Namespace Structure:**
- `semantic/land` - Physical assets (fields, soil profiles)
- `semantic/livestock` - Animal management
- `semantic/crops` - Crop types and rotations
- `semantic/carbon` - Carbon credits and baselines
- `semantic/supply-chain` - Buyers, contracts
- `episodic/seasons` - Growing cycle events
- `procedural/soil-health` - Regenerative practices

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Tiered Certification Model**: Supports multiple certification
   standards (ROC Bronze/Silver/Gold, SCI Tiers 1-4, RGN Basic/Advanced)
   reflecting the industry's multi-standard reality.

2. **Carbon Integration**: First-class entities for carbon baselines and
   credits, recognizing the growing importance of carbon markets.

3. **Supply Chain**: Includes buyer and contract entities to model
   the full value chain, not just on-farm operations.

4. **Weather Events**: Episodic events for weather impacts, enabling
   insurance and risk management integrations.

### Entity Summary

   including submission, review, and decision tracking.

3. **Content Asset Reuse**: Granular content-asset entity enables
   tracking of reusable components across titles.

| Geographic | `located`, `bounded` | Physical location |
| Stakeholder | `owned`, `contactable` | Responsibility |
| Financial | `budgeted`, `transactional` | Money tracking |
| Temporal | `scheduled`, `seasonal` | Time-based |
| Measurement | `measured`, `scored` | Quantitative data |
| Classification | `categorized`, `tagged` | Organization |
| Asset | `inventoried`, `maintainable` | Physical assets |

## Usage

### Loading an Ontology

Place the ontology file in your project's mnemonic directory:

```bash
cp ontologies/examples/biology-research-lab.ontology.yaml \
   .claude/mnemonic/ontology.yaml
```

### Creating Memories

Use the entity types and namespaces defined in the ontology:

```bash
/mnemonic:capture semantic/grants "NIH R01 Award" \
  --entity-type grant \
  --tags nih,funding
```

### Discovery Patterns

The ontology's discovery patterns will automatically suggest entity
types based on content:

```
User: "We got the R01 funded!"
Claude: Detected grant-related content. Suggesting:
  - Entity type: grant
  - Namespace: semantic/grants
```
