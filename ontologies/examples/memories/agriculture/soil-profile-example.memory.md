# North Field Soil Profile - January 2026

Annual soil health assessment for the 40-acre north field, showing
significant improvement after 3 years of regenerative practices.

## Key Findings

- **Organic Matter**: 4.2% (up from 2.8% baseline in 2023)
- **Soil Carbon**: 38.5 tons CO2e/acre (baseline was 28.2)
- **Aggregate Stability**: 72% water-stable aggregates
- **Infiltration**: 2.1 inches/hour (excellent)

## Interpretation

The fungal-to-bacterial ratio of 1.8:1 indicates successful transition
toward a fungal-dominant soil ecosystem, which is optimal for perennial
systems and carbon sequestration.

The 47% increase in organic matter over 3 years demonstrates that our
cover cropping and reduced tillage practices are working effectively.

## Recommendations

1. Continue current cover crop mix (crimson clover, cereal rye, radish)
2. Maintain no-till practices
3. Consider adding mycorrhizal inoculant to next planting
4. Sample again in 6 months to track summer changes

## Rationale

This profile establishes our 2026 baseline for carbon credit verification
under the SCI Tier 2 program. The improvements justify advancement from
Tier 1 to Tier 2 status.
